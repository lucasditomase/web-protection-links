# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is handled. I am an independent developer, and this app is designed with a "privacy-first" philosophy. 

### 1. Data Collection and Usage
I do not collect, track, or store any personal data. This app does not use third-party libraries for advertising, analytics, or tracking. All code is native Apple code, ensuring maximum security and integration with the system.

### 2. Network Extension and DNS
The app utilizes a Network Extension to provide protection. Although this may appear as a "VPN" in your system settings, it is a **Local DNS Proxy**.
• **On-Device Processing**: All domain filtering and blocking happen locally on your device. Your browsing history is never sent to me or any third party.
• **Remote Resolution**: To provide internet connectivity, unblocked domains are sent to a public DNS resolver of your choice to be translated into IP addresses.
• **Encryption**: You can choose to use encrypted DNS (DNS-over-HTTPS or DNS-over-TLS) within the app to prevent your ISP or local network from seeing your requests.

### 3. Third-Party DNS Providers
When you select a DNS provider, your unblocked requests are subject to their respective privacy policies. You can choose from the following:
• [Cloudflare Privacy Policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/)
• [Google Public DNS Privacy](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/privacy)
• [Yandex Privacy Policy](https://yandex.com/legal/confidential/)
• [Alibaba Cloud Privacy Policy](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/faq-detail/42425.htm)
• [Tencent Privacy Policy](https://www.tencent.com/en-us/privacy-policy.html)

### 4. Customer Support
If you contact me via email through the Customer Support feature:
• Your email address is used solely to respond to your inquiry.
• I do not share your email with third parties.
• I do not use your email for marketing, advertising, or spam.
• I do not use your contact information for any form of analytics.

### 5. Sandboxing and Security
The macOS version of this app operates within the system Sandbox, ensuring it only accesses the resources necessary to function, further protecting your system data.

### 6. Acceptance and Changes
By using this app, you accept the terms of this Privacy Policy. I may update this policy from time to time; any changes will be reflected in the "What's New" section of the App Store updates.
